        <p style="margin-right: 50%;color:white;">A travel package, or vacation package, is a combination of travel services<br>purchased for a single trip at a total price. These services can include <br>flights, hotels, rental cars, activities, meals, and travel insurance. Tour operators organize and advertise these packages, and travel agents sell them to consumers. 
            Travel packages can be a convenient and budget-friendly way to travel, and can help travelers save time and enjoy their vacation. Tour operators offer a wide range of packages, including options for different interests, price points, and group sizes. They can also provide support in case of emergencies.
